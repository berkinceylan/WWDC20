 # Hello, Welcome to Shapes!👋
 
 This playground aims to break down the preconceptions that students might feel about geometry. Thus, encouraged them to produce more creative solutions to the events in the future.
 
 * Callout(Tip💡):
 If you cannot click on the live view, try restarting it through the stop button in the bottom left corner.

 ## Everyone Can Code and Create 🧑‍💻🎨
 
 As an example, let's take the topic of the shape of a geometry lesson. The shapes are the simplest and easy to draw structures. In my research, I saw that moving objects increase children's imagination. However, I think that people can create even better shapes with coding and that it can become a great lesson with interactivity. Thus, individuals can gain early communication skills and the ability to produce creative solutions to problems.

 ## Accessibility🧍
 
 This playground, which I developed with SwiftUI that supports Apple’s assistive technologies, aims to help individuals with visual disabilities to perceive shapes more easily.
